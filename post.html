                    <p>Longtime roasting company Cuvée Coffee has scored a major victory for many of its peers in the beer and grocery industries after a Texas judge ruled that crowlers — which are effectively 32-ounce growlers in can form — can be sold by retailers even if they are not breweries or brewpubs.</p>
					<p>We’ve been following this story since the middle of last year when the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission (TABC) first notified Cuvée that it could no longer sell crowlers from its flagship Austin shop, where crowlers of craft beer from guest breweries was being sold for take-out alongside the shop’s other core coffee offerings.</p>
					<p>In September, the TABC followed up by seizing Cuvée’s crowler canning equipment, which Cuvée owner Mike McKim told Daily Coffee News represented an investment of several thousand dollars.</p>

                    <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

                    <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

                    <p>Two otherwise unrelated organizations utilizing specialty coffee as a means to support U.S. military veterans and their families announced major new products and initiatives surrounding the recent Veteran’s Day national holiday.</p>

                    <p>The veteran-owned roastery Coffee Vets last week launched “22 Heroes to Zero,” a crowdfunding campaign raising money to combat Post Traumatic Stress Disorder in military veterans. The group cites statistics showing that PTSD is responsible for the loss of life of more than 20 military veterans per day and it is seeking to raise at least 220,000 in 51 days, 
						with the money going to 22 organizations currently involved in PTSD treatment and research.</p>

					<p>“In the next few months, our mission is to raise money and awareness to help America’s veterans battle this staggering illness and to help them find the best care possible,” said Kip Nicely, president of Coffee Vets. “As a Veteran myself, we are proud to sponsor a campaign that will help generate hope and financial assistance for PTSD — an illness that is difficult to accept and is often overlooked.”</p>

					<p>Donors to the campaign giving $22 or more are eligible to receive bags of Coffee Vets’ coffee, which is sourced from highlands in the the Bosawás Biosphere Reserve in Nicaragua, and roasted in Burke, Va.</p>
